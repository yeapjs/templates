# Yeap Templates with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## Get started

These templates are intended to be used unchanged via the [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) utility.

```bash
# Javascript template
$ npx degit yeapjs/templates/js my-yeap-application
$ cd my-yeap-application
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn
```

```bash
# Typescript template
$ npx degit yeapjs/templates/ts my-yeap-application
$ cd my-yeap-application
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn
```

(Note: you don't need to import h or Fragment from the template, it's already imported for you with `yeap-vite-preset`)

## I don't see a template that matches my need?

You can create your own template and prefix it with `ts-` or `js-` and give it a descriptive name.
